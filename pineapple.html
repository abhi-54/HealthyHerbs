  <ul>
  <li>Pineapple (Ananas comosus) is an incredibly delicious and healthy tropical fruit.</li>
  <li>Pineapples are low in calories but have an incredibly impressive nutrient profile.</li>
  <li>Pineapples also contain trace amounts of vitamins A and K, phosphorus, zinc and calcium.</li>
  <li>They are especially rich in vitamin C and manganese, providing 131% and 76% of the daily recommendations, respectively.</li>
  <li>Oxidative stress is a state in which there are too many free radicals in the body. These free radicals interact with the body’s cells and cause damage that is linked to chronic inflammation, a weakened immune system and many harmful diseases. Pineapples are especially rich in antioxidants known as flavonoids and phenolic acids.</li>
  <li>Pineapples contain a group of digestive enzymes known as bromelain. They function as proteases, which break down protein molecules into their building blocks, such as amino acids and small peptides.</li>
  <li>Cancer is a chronic disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Its progression is commonly linked to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Several studies have shown that pineapple and its compounds may reduce the risk of cancers. This is because they may minimize oxidative stress and reduce inflammation.</li>
  <li>Another study found that children with a sinus infection recovered significantly faster while taking a bromelain supplement, compared to a standard treatment or combination of the two.</li>
  <li>Since pineapples contain bromelain, which has anti-inflammatory properties, it’s commonly thought that they may provide pain relief for those with inflammatory arthritis.</li>
  <li>Eating pineapples may reduce the time it takes to recover from surgery or exercise.</li>
  <li>Pineapples are delicious, low in calories and loaded with nutrients and antioxidants.</li>
  <li>Pineapples are also incredibly versatile and can be consumed in a variety of ways. To experience their health benefits, try incorporating pineapples into your diet.</li>
