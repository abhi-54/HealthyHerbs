        <ul>
  <li>Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection that usually attacks your lungs.</li>
  <li>It can also spread to other parts of your body, like your brain and spine. A type of bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes it.</li>
  <li>A TB infection doesn’t always mean you’ll get sick. There are two forms of the disease, Latent TB, Active TB.</li>
  <li>Latent TB- You have the germs in your body, but your immune system keeps them from spreading. You don’t have any symptoms, and you’re not contagious. But the infection is still alive and can one day become active.</li>
  <li>Active TB- The germs multiply and make you sick. You can spread the disease to others. Ninety percent of active cases in adults come from a latent TB infection.</li>
  <li>A latent or active TB infection can also be drug-resistant, meaning certain medications don’t work against the bacteria.</li>
  <li>Latent TB doesn’t have symptoms. A skin or blood test can tell if you have it.</li>
  <li>Signs of active TB disease include,A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks, Chest pain, Coughing up blood, Feeling tired all the time, Night sweats.</li>
  <li>Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread through the air, just like a cold or the flu. You can get TB only if you come into contact with people who have it.</li>
  <li>A healthy immune system fights the TB bacteria. But you might not be able to fend off active TB disease if you have HIV or AIDS, Diabetes, Severe kidney disease, Head and neck cancers.
