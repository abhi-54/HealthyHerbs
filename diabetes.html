  <uL>
    <li>Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar.</li>
    <li>The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it does make.</li>
    <li>Diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About 10 percent of people with diabetes have this type.</li>
    <li>A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.</li>
    <li>The general symptoms of diabetes include increased hunger, increadsed thirst, weight loss, frequent urination, blurry vision.</li>
    <li>In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have a decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED), and poor muscle strength.</li>
    <li>Women with diabetes can also have symptoms such as urinary tract infections, yeast infections, and dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li>Most women with gestational diabetes don’t have any symptoms. The condition is often detected during a routine blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test that is usually performed between the 24th and 28th weeks of gestation.</li>
    <li>Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.</li>
    <li>Both genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering diabetes.</li>
