        <ul>
         <li>Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.</li>
        <li>Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements.</li>
        <li>Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths.</li>
        <li>Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants.</li>
        <li>Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents.</li>
        <li>Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.</li>
        <li>The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, 
          fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat and avoiding too much sunlight exposure.</li>
        <li>Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy.</li>
        <li>The word comes from the ancient Greek καρκίνος, meaning crab and tumor. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted similarity of crabs to some tumors with swollen veins.</li>
        <li>In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths.</li>
